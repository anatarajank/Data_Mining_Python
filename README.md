# Data Mining Project

## Project Overview

This project addresses key business problem using data mining techniques:

**Customer Segmentation for Promotional Offers**

A leading bank aims to develop a customer segmentation strategy to optimize promotional offers. The project utilizes clustering methods (hierarchical and K-Means) to segment customers based on their credit card usage patterns. The resulting segments are then used to recommend targeted promotional strategies for each group.

## Usage

To execute this notebook, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- scipy

You can install these libraries using the following command:`!pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy`

Once the libraries are installed, you can run the notebook cells sequentially to perform the analysis and view the results.

## Data

The project uses two datasets:

- `bank_marketing_part1_Data-1.csv` for customer segmentation analysis

These datasets should be placed in the `data` directory as the notebook before running it.

## Results

The project provides detailed results, including cluster profiles and business recommendations.

**Customer Segmentation**

The customer segmentation analysis identifies three distinct customer segments: high-spending, medium-spending, and low-spending groups. Each segment has specific characteristics and behaviors that inform targeted promotional strategies.

## Business Insights and Recommendations

The project concludes with a set of business insights and recommendations derived from the analysis. These recommendations can be used by the bank to improve their promotional strategies and claim management processes, respectively.
